# 🥁 Drum Kit Web Application

The **Drum Kit** is an interactive and responsive web application that allows users to play drum sounds directly in their browser. Users can create beats by either **clicking on drum buttons** or **pressing specific keyboard keys**, making it a fun project to explore JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation.

This project is ideal for beginners learning **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, and demonstrates real-time user interaction with audio playback.
